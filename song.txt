All say: there is no truth on earth.
But truth is neither higher. For me
It’s clear as a simple scale.
I was born with love for art;
Being a child, when high was ringing
The organ in our ancient church,
I listened and was absorbed in listening – tears
Involuntary and sweet ran.
Idle amusements I rejected early;
Sciences, alien to music, were
Repellent to me; obstinately and arrogantly
I renounced them and devoted
Myself to music only. Hard is the first step
